# Machine-Learning-Classifier

Project Title:

Machine Learning: Classifier to categorise network packet data according to a7ack category.
Project Description:

Building a classifier in Python to categorise network packet data according to their a7ack category (Normal, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoor, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms). Using standard metrics to measure and discuss the performance of the classifier. Produced visualisaOon graphs of the data based on the obtained results
